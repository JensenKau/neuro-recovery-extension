# Automatic Prediction of Neurological Recovery from Coma in Cardiac Arrest Patients

### Project Background
The heart is one of the most important organ in the human body as it is repsonsible for pumping blood to ohter organs in the body. When a person's heart stops, the other organs in the body will slowly cease to function when it runs out of blood, a phenomenon known as a cardiac arrest.

When a person enters a cardiac arrest state, they will be taken to the hospital to be resuscitated. For most resuscitated patient, they enter a coma state after being resuscitated. These coma patients will also require life support machine to keep them alive as they are unable to support themselves in a coma state. 

Due to the limited amount of resources, doctors will sometimes remove the life support from the patient if their prognosis does not show promising recovery, which raises a concern if any of these patient who had their life support machine removed could have recovered. Additionally, the process of generating these prognosis is also very labour intensive and time consuming.

Therefore, to reduce the labour and time required for generating the prognosis and to also generate a more acurate prognosis, a deep learning model can be used to achieve these goals. 

### Project Goal
To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Deep Learning model that is capable of predicting the neurological recovery of a coma patient at a high degree of accuracy.
